# Operation Ideas:
# * These situations should happen on their own, too.
# - Steal Technology+
# - Decrease Stablility
# - Arm Rebellion (super duper hard, 80 infiltration and expensive)
# - Increase Crime (easier for syndicates?)
# - Spawn Privateers+ (stronger, multiple locations)
# - Diplomatic Incident+ (break apart federations, allies)
# - Steal branch office (ends with bidding war)

# How the operation situations should generally work:
#  1. The situation is caused by the last stage.
#  2. The progress of the situation during the last stage determines the operation's success.
#     (lower progress is better for the infiltrator, worse for infiltrated)
